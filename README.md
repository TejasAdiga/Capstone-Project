# Capstone-Project
Semi-Autonomous Wheelchair based on line-follower method, Embedded &amp; IOT concepts

> sercheck.py is for the UART communication on Raspberry Pi side based on serial library.
> GUIMot.py is for touchscreen interface on Raspberry Pi based on Tkinter Library.
> serial_check.ino is for UART communication on Arduino side.
> Motor_control.ino is for sending appropriate messages to motor controller to manipulate motors  based on messages recieved from Raspberry Pi, all communications are following UART protocol.
> normalrun.ino is the standalone hard coding on Arduino for manipulation of motors(used in the 6th SEM final presenations).
